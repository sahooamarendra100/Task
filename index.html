          <p class="display-5">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Ans: </span> A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet   users can access your website.
            A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number.
            However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify
            entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.

            A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.
